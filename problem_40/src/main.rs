/*
 * An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers:
 * 0.12345678910 1 112131415161718192021...
 * It can be seen that the 12th digit of the fractional part is 1
 * If d_n represents the nth digit of the fractional part, find the value of the following expression.
 * d_1 * d_{10} * d_{100} * d_{1000} * d_{10000} * d_{100000} * d_{1000000}
